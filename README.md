## UX

### Wireframes<hr>

I utilized Balsamic (<https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/>) to design the wireframes for my website. I began by creating the wireframes for the desktop version and subsequently adapted the homepage diagram for tablet and mobile devices to display the concept.

### Structure<hr>

My website development approach will prioritize mobile devices, adopting a mobile-first mindset. To ensure optimal styling across different screen sizes, I will focus on the smallest screen size of the iPhone 5/SE (320px) and incorporate appropriate screen size breakpoints for responsive design.[Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap breakpoints").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

## Database

### Database Overview

The project will use the PostgreSQL database for storing data. Two diagramgs were created to show the difference between the initial schema created during the design iteration prior to any development and the final schema created after development was completed.

## Branding

Hook 'n' Slice Goal is a welcoming brand that fosters a friendly environment specifically designed for new golfers. With a commitment to supporting beginners throughout their golfing journey, we provide a supportive and inclusive space where individuals can learn, grow, and enjoy the game of golf to the fullest.

### Logo <hr>

The logo for Hook 'n' Slice Golf is thoughtfully designed to attract beginner golfers by visually communicating a welcoming and supportive atmosphere, encouraging progression, and evoking a sense of accomplishment in their golfing journey.

- The two stripes, represent the journey of beginner golfers. The blue represents the initial stages of learning and improvement, while the green symbolizes progress and advancement, this links in with the colour palette of the website. This logo emphasises the purpose of the brand and website which is to inspire beginners by showcasing a path of growth and development in their golfing skills.

- The golf hole with a flag within the logo emphasizes the feeling of achievement associated with the game of golf. This visual element aims to motivate beginner golfers by showcasing the exciting milestones and accomplishments they can strive for as they progress in their golfing journey.

### Colour Scheme<hr>

The colour scheme for the website is focused on simplicity, trust and calmness all concepts which we hope will attract beginner golfers. The pallete consists of three colours in total; White, a dark green called <strong>Fun Green</strong> and a dark blue called <strong>St Tropaz</strong>.

The darker shades of blue and green have a psychological impact of conveying a sense of trust, reliability and calming which we hope will encourage beigning golfers to choose us as their home of golf.

Purpose of each colour:

- Fun Green - #006630 - Main Brand Colour - A vibrant, full-bodied deep green colour to represent the lush green fairways, rolling hills and well-maintained greens this creates a strong connection between the brand and a positive golfing experience. This is the main colour for the brand and aims to symbolises reliability, continuous improvement and progression that beginner golfers strive for in their game.

- St Tropaz - #295899 - Accents - Blue is often associated with calmness, serenity, and tranquility. This shade of blue, conveys a sense of peacefulness and can evoke images of clear skies or water bodies, creating a soothing and relaxing ambiance. It can be particularly appealing to beginner golfers who may seek a tranquil and enjoyable experience on the golf course.

- White - #ffffff - Background - Creates a clean and simple canvas which will allow other elements such as the text, images and icons to stand out prominently. The fresh look will be particular appealing to beginner golfers who will appreciate a clear and uncluttered background (they already have enough to handle figuring out how to play golf let alone trying to book a tee time)

### Fonts<hr>

I have used google fonts to select a font type that best supports the goals of the website, to provide a course for beginers to start their golfing journey. For the main text I have selected [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=Open%20Sans&preview.text_type=custom&query=Open+Sans "Open Sans"). To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Fredoka](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka?preview.text=Open%20Sans&preview.text_type=custom&query=Fredok "Fredoka").

Reasons for choosing the fonts:

- <strong>Open Sans:</strong> is chosen for the body text due to its readability. With a clean and modern appearance, it ensures clear communication of information to beginner golfers, aligning with the brand's focus on simplicity and clarity.

- <strong>Fredoka:</strong> is selected as the title font to bring a playful and friendly element to the brand. With its rounded and inviting design, it adds a touch of excitement and light-heartedness to the headings, perfectly capturing the brand's aim to provide a freindly open environment for beginer golfers to play golf.

## Agile Methodology

### Prioritisation<hr>

After developing my backlog of criteria I reviewed each user story in respect to the epic goal and set the priority of the user story using labels in github proejects.

To deterimine the priority I use the MoSCoW prioritization technique which is widely-used agile project management that aids in making informed decisions about which requirements or features should take precedence during development. The method involves dividing requirements into four categories:

1. Must Have (M): These are critical features that are non-negotiable and must be delivered in the current release. They form the core functionality and are essential for the project's success.

2. Should Have (S): These are important features that significantly enhance the product but are not as critical as 'Must Have' items. They are considered essential for the overall project success but may be deferred to a later release if necessary.

3. Could Have (C): These are desirable features, but their absence does not hinder the core functionality. They represent enhancements or nice-to-haves that can be considered for inclusion if time and resources allow.

4. Won't Have (W): These are features deemed unnecessary for the current project scope. They are intentionally excluded from the development process, either due to time constraints, technical limitations, or low business value. In my project no label was used to represent the won't have user stories. Instead during each sprint if a user story could not be completed then the story was moved to the status descoped to represent it wouldn't be included in the scope of the project.

In my project some of user stories were not completed even if they were marked with the label Must Have. This is becasue the overall Epic the User Story relates to was descoped due to capacity restraints.

### Sprints<hr>

### Epics & User Stories<hr>

There was a total of 50 user stories and 11 epic created in my backlog.

Only 22 of the user stories were completed, 28 were moved to descoped as there was not enough time to complete the associated epic. All of the user stories can be found on the following [Git Hub board](https://github.com/users/Oran-123/projects/2/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C43732427%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Milestone%22%5D&layout=board&filterQuery=)

The below table includes the Epic, User Stories and the Acceptance Criteria of the User Stories that were completed:
