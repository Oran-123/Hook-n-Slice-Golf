## Overview

## Site Objectives

## UX

### Wireframes<hr>
I utilized Balsamic (<https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/>) to design the wireframes for my website. I began by creating the wireframes for the desktop version and subsequently adapted the homepage diagram for tablet and mobile devices to display the concept.

### Database Schema<hr>

### Branding<hr>

#### Logo

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website is focused on simplicity, trust and calmness all concepts which we hope will attract beginner golfers. The pallete consists of three colours in total; White, a dark green called <strong>Fun Green</strong>and a dark blue called <strong>St Tropaz</strong>.

The darker shades of blue and green have a psychological impact of conveying a sense of trust, reliability and calming which we hope will encourage beigning golfers to choose us as their home of golf.

Purpose of each colour: 

  * Fun Green - #006630 - Main Brand Colour - A vibrant, full-bodied deep green colour (#7FFF7F) to represent the lush green fairways, rolling hills and well-maintained greens this creates a strong connection between the brand and a positive golfing experience. This is the main colour for the brand and aims to symbolises reliability, continuous improvement and progression that beginner golfers strive for in their game.
  
  * St Tropaz - #295899 - Accents - Blue is often associated with calmness, serenity, and tranquility. This shade of blue, conveys a sense of peacefulness and can evoke images of clear skies or water bodies, creating a soothing and relaxing ambiance. It can be particularly appealing to beginner golfers who may seek a tranquil and enjoyable experience on the golf course.

  * White - #ffffff - Background - Creates a clean and simple canvas which will allow other elements such as the text, images and icons to stand out prominently. The fresh look will be particular appealing to beginner golfers who will appreciate a clear and uncluttered background (they already have enough to handle figuring out how to play golf let alone trying to book a tee time)
